            Doctor Strange, American comic-book superhero created for Marvel Comics by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. The character first appeared in a backup strip in Strange Tales no. 110 in July 1963 but soon blossomed into one of the cult characters of the decade and a staple in the Marvel pantheon.Origin and development in the Silver Age
            Magicians had long been a staple of comics. Lee Falk’s Mandrake the Magician comic strip debuted in 1934, and Fred Guardineer’s Zatara followed in Action Comics no. 1 in June 1938. Doctor Strange broke with the stage conjurer imagery of these prior comic magicians and potently mixed sorcery with the energy of superheroes to create something unique.            
            In his origin story, vain, egotistical neurosurgeon Stephen Strange injures his hands in a car crash. Attempts to heal his hands using science and medicine fail, and a desperate Strange travels to Tibet to find the fabled “Ancient One,” who he hopes will restore him to health. On finding the old sage, Strange becomes his acolyte and a “Master of the Mystic Arts.”            
            Doctor Strange was a comic unlike any other. As Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, the hero traveled to other dimensions and fought unique villains such as Nightmare, Eternity, and the dread Dormammu. References to the Eye of Agamotto and the Great Book of the Vishanti hinted at almost unimaginable wonders. Lee kept the dialogue exciting and enjoyably florid, punctuating Strange’s speech with exclamations such as “By the hoary hosts of Hoggoth!” Ditko provided much of the story plotting, and his illustrations complemented Lee’s sometimes outrageous prose with eye-catching images that pushed the boundaries of the comic art of the day.
            Doctor Strange, his extradimensional love interest Clea, and his assistant Wong operated out of their Gothic “sanctum sanctorum” in the heart of New York City’s Greenwich Village. By the time of 1967’s “Summer of Love,” the Doctor Strange comic had been widely adopted by the hippie movement, and its spells and alternate realities were widely believed to resemble LSD trips. Doctor Strange appeared on handbills for concerts in the San Francisco Bay area and on the cover of a Pink Floyd album. He was, in effect, the psychedelic superhero. The irony was that his creators were middle-aged professionals with years of comics work behind them; Ditko in particular was known for his conservative views and distrust of hippies.Doctor Strange, American comic-book superhero created for Marvel Comics by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko.

By the time of 1967’s “Summer of Love,” the Doctor Strange comic had been widely adopted by the hippie movement, and its spells and alternate realities were widely believed to resemble LSD trips. Doctor Strange appeared on handbills for concerts in the San Francisco Bay area and on the cover of a Pink Floyd album. He was, in effect, the psychedelic superhero. The irony was that his creators were middle-aged professionals with years of comics work behind them; Ditko in particular was known for his conservative views and distrust of hippies.
